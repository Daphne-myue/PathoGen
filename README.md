# PathoGen

PathoGen is a learning and development repository focused on analyzing pathological mutations and integrating them with genomic information. This project aims to explore computational methods and workflows for studying pathological data, enabling deeper insights into mutation patterns in disease contexts.

## Features

- Processing and analyzing pathological mutation datasets
- Integrating pathology findings with genomic data
- Developing pipelines and scripts for data extraction and visualization
- Facilitating research on genotype-phenotype relationships

## Purpose

The repository serves as a platform for experimenting with bioinformatics tools and techniques related to pathology and genomics. It supports combining mutation data from pathology images and reports with underlying genomic information to enhance biological understanding and potentially aid clinical research.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and explore the scripts and notebooks for pathology and genomics data processing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PathoGen.git
cd PathoGen
